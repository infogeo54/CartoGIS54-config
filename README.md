## Form

Using QGIS, you can use the Attributes form in order to create widgets that help you to edit data fields easily.

The idea there is to reuse those widgets in the Form component of the Carto54 Web app.

The main main action of this section is invisible for the user because the plugin is only retrieving data that have been specified by the user inside *Attribute form*.

Nevertheless, you can use the plugin to configure fields display rules.

### Display

You just have to tick the corresponding checkbox of the field that you want to disable or hide.

Modals can be configured inside the **Modals** section of the plugin.

By adding an entry, you'll tell the Web app to create a modal and add a button into the **Header** part of the interface.

### Adding an entry

1. Click *Add row* to create a new entry
2. Fill every cells to configure the modal :
    * `name` : this will be used to create the modal's HTML file and create the link between the modal and the button to toggle it
    * `title` : this will be displayed inside the modal's header
    * `icon` : the icon that will be associated to the modal trigger button inside the Web app header. Available icons are from FontAwesome can be found [here](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) (check the [config sample](https://github.com/infogeo54/carto54-config/blob/master/sample/app.config.json) to know how to add an icon)
